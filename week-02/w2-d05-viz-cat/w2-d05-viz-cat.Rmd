## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

## Data: Lending Club

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.align = "right"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lending-club.png")
```

```{r}
loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  select(loan_amount, interest_rate, term, grade, 
         state, annual_income, homeownership)
glimpse(loans)
```

# Bar plot

---

## Bar plot

```{r}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

## Segmented bar plot

```{r}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership, 
                  fill = grade)) + #<<
  geom_bar()
```

---

## Segmented bar plot

```{r}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership, fill = grade)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") #<<
```

.question[
Which bar plot is a more useful representation for visualizing the relationship between gender and hair color?
]

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership, fill = grade)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership, fill = grade)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```
]

## Customizing bar plots

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label = "bar-custom", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r bar-custom, fig.show = "hide", warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(y = homeownership, #
                  fill = grade)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs( #<<
    x = "Proportion", #<<
    y = "Homeownership", #<<
    fill = "Grade", #<<
    title = "Grades of Lending Club loans and homeownership of lendee" #<<
  ) #<<

# Relationships between numerical and categorical variables

## Already talked about...

- Coloring and faceting histograms and density plots
- Side-by-side histograms

---

## Violin plots

```{r warning = FALSE}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = homeownership, y = loan_amount)) +
  geom_violin()
```

---

## Ridge plots

```{r warning = FALSE}
library(ggridges)
ggplot(loans, aes(x = loan_amount, y = grade, fill = grade, color = grade)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5)
```
